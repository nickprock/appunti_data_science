# Comparision between OpneAi and Cohere
In this experiments I replicate the Jupyter code notebooks of ["ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" by DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) to compare [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) API.

## Start
1. Go into `prompt-engineering-notes`
2. Install requirements from `requirements.txt` with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Into `prompt-engineering-notes` directory create a `config.yml` file and write:

```
openai_key: your_api_key
cohere_key: your_api_key
```

## Goal
The goal isn't to suggest the better service but to compare the services, they are very similar, and to helping developers choose the one best suited to their problem.

## The Course
I ["ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" by DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) the course and found it very interesting, I recommend it.
